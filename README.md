# Obsidian Table Drag

Resize Markdown table columns — and optionally row heights — with simple drag handles. Works in Reading view and Live Preview. Sizes are saved per table so your layout stays consistent.

## Features
- Drag to resize table columns with visible handles
- Optional row height handles (can be turned on/off)
- Double‑click a handle to Autofit or Reset (your choice in settings)
- Keyboard-friendly: Arrow keys to resize; Enter/Space to trigger the double‑click action
- Smart snapping for clean layouts (hold Ctrl/Cmd to bypass)
- Persists sizes per table and file
- Option to wrap long text/URLs in cells


## How to use
- Resize columns: In Reading view and Live Preview, hover near a column edge to reveal a vertical handle, then drag.
- Autofit or Reset: Double‑click a handle. The action is configurable (Autofit by default; Reset splits the two adjacent columns evenly).
- Keyboard controls: Click a handle or press Tab until it’s focused, then use:
  - ArrowLeft / ArrowRight to resize by the configured step (default 8px)
  - Hold Ctrl/Cmd for 1px precision moves
  - Enter / Space to perform the configured double‑click action
- Row heights (optional): If enabled, use the horizontal handle at the bottom of each row to drag. With the handle focused:
  - ArrowUp / ArrowDown adjusts height by the configured step
  - Enter / Space clears a manually set row height

Tip: If you prefer to avoid accidental drags, enable “Require Alt key to drag” in settings. Then hold Alt while dragging.
